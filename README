DisableActivercordValidation
============================

This is just a wrapper for a simple mixin to handle Active Record disable validations.

Example
=======

This model shows the example, how to extend yours:

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

    # 1. Include the main mixin from your model:
    include CanDisableValidation

    # 2. extend the critical validator expressions like this below:
    validates_uniqueness_of :title, :unless => :validation_disabled?

    # or you can use other keywords too ...
    validate_presence_of :author, :if => :validation_enabled?

end


You are now able to save without validations:

b = Book.new( :author => nil )
b.disable_validation!
b.save!

b.title = 'Kutyafej'
b.enable_validation!
b.save!

# => throws exception, becaouse the missing author ...
